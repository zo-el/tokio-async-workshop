## Overview

[`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs with context-aware,
structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides
compatibility layers for using `tracing` alongside the logging facade provided
by the [`log`] crate.

This crate provides:

- [`LogTracer`], a [`log::Log`] implementation that consumes [`log::Record`]s
  and outputs them as [`tracing::Event`].
- [`TraceLogger`], a [`tracing::Subscriber`] implementation that consumes
  [`tracing::Event`]s and outputs [`log::Record`], allowing an existing logger
  implementation to be used to record trace events.
