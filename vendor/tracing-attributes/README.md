## Overview

[`tracing`] is a framework for instrumenting Rust programs to collect
structured, event-based diagnostic information. This crate provides the
`#[instrument]` attribute for automatically instrumenting functions using
`tracing`.

Note that this macro is also re-exported by the main `tracing` crate.

## Usage

First, add this to your `Cargo.toml`:

```toml
[dependencies]
tracing-attributes = "0.1.3"
```

This crate provides the `#[instrument]` attribute for instrumenting a function
with a `tracing` [span]. For example:

```rust
use tracing_attributes::instrument;

#[instrument]
pub fn my_function(my_arg: usize) {
    // ...
}
```
